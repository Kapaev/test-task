## Overview
`SimpleServer` is a lightweight HTTP server designed to handle financial transactions and withdrawal requests for users. Upon instantiation, the server initializes with two users, Bob and Alice, and binds to a specified port number. The server provides endpoints for transferring money, making withdrawal requests, and checking the status of operations.

## Initialization

To start a `SimpleServer` instance, provide a port number:
```java
SimpleServer server = new SimpleServer(8080);
```
